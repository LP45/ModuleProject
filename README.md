My game is called Rock Paper Scissors.
The reason I created this game is because I wanted to understand and implement HTML,CSS,JS.d 
Ive also used DOM munipulation and an ample of functions to allow my code to run seamlessly
The overall idea of this game is to create the ability to choose btwn three different options(buttons) of your chosing with a 30% chance of winning
If you Win you will be rewarded a point.
If the computer wins the computer will be rewarded a point.
If both the player and the computer click on the same button in the same round that will result in a tie.
May the best man Win!
